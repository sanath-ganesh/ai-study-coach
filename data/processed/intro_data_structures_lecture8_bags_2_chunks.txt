Observations about Vending Machines 20INFO 6205 -ProgramStructureand AlgorithmsFall 2024 §Can perform only tasks specific to ADT §Must adhere to the specifications of the operations of ADT§Cannot access data inside ADT without ADT operations§Use the ADT, even if don’t know how data is stored§Usable even with new implementation Observations about ADT Bag Sets 22INFO 6205 -ProgramStructureand AlgorithmsFall 2024 §A special kind of bag, one that does not allow repeated, or duplicate, entries.§Most of the bag’s operations are the same for the ADT set, but need to modify addand remove.§Furthermore, no need to have getFrequencyOf. (Why?)§We can use contains method instead. The ADT Set Listing 1-5: A Java interface for a class of sets 24INFO 6205 -ProgramStructureand AlgorithmsFall 2024 §Belong to package java.util within Java Class Library§Sets that adhere to the specification do not contain a pair of equal objects x and y, i.e., x.equals(y) is true.§There are differences between interfaces Set and SetInterface. Java Class Library: The Interface Set 25INFO 6205 -ProgramStructureand AlgorithmsFall 2024 §Please download “L8_E1” from the “In-class Exercise” folder in Canvas.§The project has “Bag.java” and “BagInterface.java” files where Bag class implements BagInteface interface. §Create a testing program (MyBag.java) that creates a Bag object to add and remove some fruits:−add “Apple”, add “Banana”, add “Orange”, remove “Banana”, add “Apple”§Print out: (1) the total number of fruits in the bag, and (2) the total number of “Apple” in the bag Exercise 26INFO 6205 -ProgramStructureand AlgorithmsFall 2024 Answerpublic class MyBag { public static void main(String[] args) { // TODO Auto-generated method stub BagInterface<String> mybag= newBag<>(); mybag.add("Apple"); mybag.add("Banana"); mybag.add("Orange"); mybag.remove("Banana"); mybag.add("Apple"); System.out.println("Total number in bag is: " + mybag.getCurrentSize()); System.out.println("Total number of Apple is: " + mybag.getFrequencyOf("Apple")); }}
