Shell (March 1, 1924 – November 2, 2015) 3INFO 6205 -ProgramStructureand AlgorithmsFall 2024 §An array entry moves to an adjacent location.§When an entry is far from its correct sorted position, it must make many such moves.§When an array is completely scrambled, an insertion sort takes a good deal (a lot) of time.§When an array is almost sorted, an insertion sort is more efficient. Observation from Insertion Sort 4INFO 6205 -ProgramStructureand AlgorithmsFall 2024 §Algorithms seen so far are simple but inefficient for large arrays at 𝑂(𝑛!).§Note, the more sorted an array is, the less work insertInOrder must do.§Improved insertion sort developed by Donald Shell. Shell Sort 5INFO 6205 -ProgramStructureand AlgorithmsFall 2024 §Move entries beyond their adjacent locations.§Use Insertion Sort repeatedly§Steps:−Create subarrays of entries at equally spaced indices−Run Insertion Sort to each subarray−Merge subarrays−Reduce space to half and repeat above steps until space becomes 1 Shell Sort (cont.) 6INFO 6205 -ProgramStructureand AlgorithmsFall 2024Figure 15-11, 15-12: An array and the subarrays formed by grouping entries whose indices are 6 apart.

Shell Sort 10INFO 6205 -ProgramStructureand AlgorithmsFall 2024 §Please implement a method shellSort() that sorts an array of integers by using Shell Sort algorithm. §The array has 30 random generated integers§The shellSort() takes int[] as a parameter, i.e., shellSort(int[] a) and return void. Exercise (L27_E1) public class MyShellSort { public static void main(String[] args){ int size = 30; int[] data = new int[size]; Random generator = new Random(); for(int i = 0; i < size; i++){ data[i] = generator.nextInt(size); } shellSort(data); System.out.println(Arrays.toString(data)); } publicstaticvoidshellSort(int[] a) {intincrement = a.length/ 2;while(increment > 0) {for(inti= increment; i< a.length; i++) {intj = i;inttemp = a[i];while(j >= increment && a[j -increment] > temp) {a[j] = a[j -increment];j = j -increment;}a[j] = temp;}increment = increment / 2;}}} Answer 12INFO 6205 -ProgramStructureand AlgorithmsFall 2024 The time efficiencies of three sorting algorithms, expressed in Big Oh notation Comparing the Algorithms Best CaseAverage CaseWorst CaseSelection SortO(n2) O(n2) O(n2)Insertion SortO(n) O(n2) O(n2)Shell SortO(n) O(n1.5) O(n1.5) [1] The Complexity of Shellsort: https://www.baeldung.com/cs/shellsort-complexity
