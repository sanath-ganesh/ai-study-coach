Exercise 23INFO 6205 -ProgramStructureand AlgorithmsFall 2024 ExerciseQ: A class can implement more than one interface by using extends. 24INFO 6205 -ProgramStructureand AlgorithmsFall 2024 §False. A Class can implement more than one interfaces by using “implements”, not “extends”. §For example: Answer public interface Mammal{ public void eat(); public void travel();}public interface Human{ public void study();}public class Kids implements Mammal, Human{ public void study(){...} public void eat(){...} public void travel(){...}} 25INFO 6205 -ProgramStructureand AlgorithmsFall 2024 ExerciseQ: When comparing two quantities of a class type to see whether they are “equal,” we should use ==. 26INFO 6205 -ProgramStructureand AlgorithmsFall 2024 §False§We normally use the method equals when testing two objects to see whether they are “equal.” The only time you would use == is if you wanted to see whether the objects were in the same place in memory, that is , were identical. Answer 27INFO 6205 -ProgramStructureand AlgorithmsFall 2024 ExerciseQ: The outer LinkedBag class can access the data fields of the inner Node class directly without using set and get methods. 28INFO 6205 -ProgramStructureand AlgorithmsFall 2024 §TrueAnswer 29INFO 6205 -ProgramStructureand AlgorithmsFall 2024 ExerciseQ: A chain requires less memory than an array of the same length. 30INFO 6205 -ProgramStructureand AlgorithmsFall 2024 §False§A chain needs more memory to store references to linked nodes. Answer Type 4: Short Answer 32INFO 6205 -ProgramStructureand AlgorithmsFall 2024 §Why is it better to implement the add operation in a collection before implementing the remove operation? Exercise 33INFO 6205 -ProgramStructureand AlgorithmsFall 2024 §You cannot test remove functionality until you have written and tested add functionality.
