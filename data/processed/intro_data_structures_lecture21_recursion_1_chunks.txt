Prof. Chen-Hsiang (Jones) Yu, Ph.D.College of Engineering What Is Recursion? 3INFO 6205 -ProgramStructureand AlgorithmsFall 2024 §Consider hiring a contractor to build»He hires a subcontractor for a portion of the job»That subcontractor hires a sub-subcontractor to do a smaller portion of job§The last sub-sub- … subcontractor finishes»Each one finishes and reports “done” up the line What Is Recursion? 4INFO 6205 -ProgramStructureand AlgorithmsFall 2024 Figure 9-1: Counting down from 10 Example: The Countdown 5INFO 6205 -ProgramStructureand AlgorithmsFall 2024 Figure 9-1: Counting down from 10 Example: The Countdown 6INFO 6205 -ProgramStructureand AlgorithmsFall 2024 Figure 9-1: Counting down from 10 Example: The Countdown 7INFO 6205 -ProgramStructureand AlgorithmsFall 2024 Recursive Java method to do countdown. Example: The Countdown /** Counts down from a given positive integer.@paraminteger An integer > 0.*/publicstaticvoidcountDown(intinteger){System.out.println(integer);if(integer > 1)countDown(integer -1);} // end countDown 8INFO 6205 -ProgramStructureand AlgorithmsFall 2024 §Recursion is a problem-solving process »Breaks a problem into identical but smaller problems.§A method that calls itself is a recursive method. »The invocation is a recursive call or recursive invocation. Definition 9INFO 6205 -ProgramStructureand AlgorithmsFall 2024 §Method must be given an input value.§Method definition must contain logic that involves this input, leads to different cases.§One or more cases should provide solution that does not require recursion.»Otherwise, it is an infinite recursion§One or more cases must include a recursive invocation. Design Guidelines 10INFO 6205 -ProgramStructureand AlgorithmsFall 2024 §While iterative method contains a loop, recursive method calls itself.§Some recursive methods contain a loop and call themselves.»If the recursive method with loop uses while, make sure you did not mean to use an if statement. Programming Tip Tracing a Recursive Method 12INFO 6205 -ProgramStructureand AlgorithmsFall 2024 Figure 9-2: The effect of the method call countDown(3) Tracing a Recursive Method 13INFO 6205 -ProgramStructureand AlgorithmsFall 2024Figure 9-3: Tracing the execution of countdown(3) Tracing a Recursive Method 14INFO 6205 -ProgramStructureand AlgorithmsFall 2024 Figure 9-4: The stack of activation records during the execution of the call countDown(3) Tracing a Recursive Method 15INFO 6205 -ProgramStructureand AlgorithmsFall 2024 §Each call to a method generates an activation record.§Recursive method uses more memory than an iterative method.»Each recursive call generates an activation record.§If recursive call generates too many activation records, it could cause stack overflow. Stack of Activation Records 16INFO 6205 -ProgramStructureand AlgorithmsFall 2024 Recursive method to calculate Recursive Methods That Return a Value /** @paramn An integer > 0.@returnThe sum 1 + 2 + ... + n.*/publicstaticintsumOf(intn){intsum;if(n == 1)sum = 1; // Base caseelsesum = sumOf(n -1) + n; // Recursive callreturnsum;} // end sumOf 17INFO 6205 -ProgramStructureand AlgorithmsFall 2024Figure 9-5: Tracing the execution of sumOf(3) Tracing a Recursive Method 18INFO 6205 -ProgramStructureand AlgorithmsFall 2024 §A child is running up a staircase with n steps, and can hop either 1 step, 2 steps, or 3 steps at a time.§Implement a method to count how many possible ways the child can run up the stairs. Exercise (L21_E1) 19INFO 6205 -ProgramStructureand AlgorithmsFall 2024 Answerpublic class L21_E1 { public static void main(String[] args){ //Assume the staircase has 20 steps int result = countWays(20); System.out.println("There are " + result + " ways"); } private static int countWays(int n){ if(n<0){ return 0; }else if(n == 0){ return 1; }else{ returncountWays(n-1)+countWays(n-2)+countWays(n-3); } }}
