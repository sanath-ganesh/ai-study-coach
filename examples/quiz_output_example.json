      {
        "question": "What is the definition of an Abstract Data Type (ADT)?",
        "options": [
          "A specification that describes a data set and the operations on that data, independent of implementation",
          "A specific implementation of a data structure in Java",
          "A collection that allows duplicate items",
          "A programming language feature for encapsulation"
        ],
        "correct_index": 0,
        "explanation": "An ADT is a specification that describes a data set and the operations on that data without indicating how to store or implement them, independent of any programming language.",

        "options": ["implements", "extends", "interface", "import"],
        "correct_index": 0,
        "explanation": "A class can implement more than one interface by using the 'implements' keyword, not 'extends'.",

        "correct_index": 0,
        "explanation": "The worst-case time complexity for searching a linked-based bag ADT is O(n) because it may require checking each entry.",
        "source": "Source 5"
      },
      {
        "question": "Why is it better to implement the add operation in a collection before implementing the remove operation?",
        "options": [
          "Because you cannot test remove functionality until you have written and tested add functionality",
          "Because remove is more complex than add",
          "Because add operation uses less memory",
          "Because remove operation requires inheritance"

        "question": "In a linked implementation of a stack, where is the top of the stack best placed?",
        "options": [
          "At the beginning (head) of the linked list",
          "At the end (tail) of the linked list",

        "correct_index": 0,
        "explanation": "Placing the stack’s top entry at the beginning of the chain is easiest and fastest to access, making push, pop, and peek operations efficient.",
