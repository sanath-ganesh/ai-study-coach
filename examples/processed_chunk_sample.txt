Exercise 24INFO 6205 -ProgramStructureand AlgorithmsFall 2024 §Let’s define a character of interest as only those characters to be considered for the palindrome (e.g. not white space or punctuation). §First compute the number of characters of interest in the string and call it 𝑁. Push the first 𝑁/2 characters of interest from the input onto the stack. §If 𝑁 is odd, discard the middle character (index = 𝑁/2) of interest from the input. Now compare the remaining 𝑁/2 characters of interest in the input with the characters popped from the stack. §If we find a pair that is not the same (ignoring case), the string was not a palindrome; otherwise it was a palindrome.
